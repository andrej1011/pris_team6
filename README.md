# FPGA Visualization Tool

**A specialized CLI application for visualizing and analyzing FPGA routing results generated by the VTR (Verilog-to-Routing) toolchain.**

Developed for the **Information Systems Development Process (PRIS)** university course, this project provides critical insights into chip architecture, signal congestion, and routing conflicts for advanced Electronic Design Automation (EDA) research.

**Team:** PRIS Team 6 (Andrej Rajkov and Jovan Stepančev)

**Date:** October 2025

## 💡 The Problem and Our Solution

Advanced research and design in FPGA chips and their accompanying CAD algorithms (like VTR/VPR) often face open questions regarding optimal architecture and placement/routing strategies. Answering these questions requires tools that can visualize and extract statistical data from the routing results.

Our solution is a dedicated visualization tool that processes VTR routing data and provides researchers with multiple analytical views (graphs, heatmaps, and reports) to study signal behavior, congestion, and conflicts.

## 🚀 Key Features and Visualizations

The tool processes VTR's `.route` file format and provides several key functionalities via a menu-driven CLI:

 ### Architecture Visualization
    
- **Chip Layout:** Displays the 2D matrix of CLBs (Configurable Logic Blocks) and IO (Input/Output) blocks.
  
- **Routing Edges:** Optionally shows the conceptual interconnecting edges and routing channels.
        
### Signal Routing Visualization
- **Path Tracing:** Draws the physical path (routing tree) of individual or multiple selected signals across the chip's routing resources (wires and switch blocks).  

- **Filtering:** Allows advanced filtering and visualization of signals based on metrics like the number of sink nodes (MINSINK/MAXSINK) or the size of their bounding box (MINBB/MAXBB).

- **Signal Reports:** Generates detailed text reports of filtered signals, including their calculated Bounding Box dimensions (e.g., area, height, width).
        
### Bounding Box (BB) Analysis
    
-   **Visualization:** Highlights the smallest described rectangle, or **Bounding Box**, encompassing a signal's routing path, a key metric for wirelength estimation ($\text{HPWL}$ - Half-Perimeter Wirelength).
        
-   **Overlap Reporting:** Generates a detailed report listing every pair of signals whose bounding boxes overlap, providing coordinates and conflict pairs.
        
### Heatmap Visualization
    
-   **Congestion Mapping:** Displays the spatial distribution of node utilization/congestion across the chip.
        
-   **Utilization Legend:** Uses a color-coded legend to show how frequently routing nodes are used, highlighting highly-congested areas.
        
-   **Node Report:** Outputs a textual report detailing heavily and moderately utilized routing nodes, listing the count of signals and their IDs passing through them.
        
### Conflict Graph Analysis
    
-   **Conflict Report:** Generates a report identifying all signal pairs that conflict (share resources) during the PathFinder iterative routing process.
        
-   **Conflict Weight:** Reports the weight of the conflict (e.g., number of shared nodes), which is crucial for analyzing routing difficulty.



## 🛠️ Technology Stack

**Core Tool Context**: Verilog-to-Routing (VTR)

**Supported Systems**: macOS, Windows, and Linux

## 💻 Installation and Usage

The application is run via a Command-Line Interface (CLI) and requires Python 3.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/andrej1011/pris_team6/
cd pris_team6
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

The primary required library for visualization is `matplotlib`.

```
pip install matplotlib
```

### 3. Running the Tool

Start the application from the main directory:

```
python3 main.py
```
**For English speakers**, run the translated script `main_eng.py` instead:
```
python3 main_eng.py
```

This will launch the main menu, allowing you to select visualization and reporting options.

### 4. Output Management

For every execution, the program logs metadata and outputs:

-   **Log Reports:** A detailed log report is automatically generated (e.g., `log_70.log`), recording the execution time, input file, selected options, and names of all generated output files.
    
-   **Generated Files:** Visualizations (PNG images) and textual reports (e.g., `heatmap_report_75.log`) are saved to folders `slike/` and `reports/` respectively.
